# HealthcareKiosk
India's digital healthcare transformation is accelerating, but key challenges remain in rural outreach, interoperability, and clinical resource optimization. This project envisions a next-generation AI-Powered Healthcare Kiosk, designed to deliver inclusive, intelligent, and accessible healthcare services across India.

Objectives
Deploy AI-powered kiosks aligned with ABDM, DHIS, and PM-JAY frameworks.

Integrate facial recognition-based check-ins, AI-driven symptom analysis, and multilingual LLM chatbots.

Utilize Federated Learning to enable privacy-preserving, on-device AI model training.

Seamlessly integrate with India Stack for identity verification (ABHA), payments (UPI), and health data exchange.

🧠 Key Technologies
Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning

Federated Learning for privacy-first AI model updates

Computer Vision (Face ID Recognition)

Natural Language Processing (LLMs in Indian languages)

OpenVINO™ / Intel® OneAPI for AI inference optimization

e-Sanjeevani Telemedicine Integration

ABDM APIs and India Stack (DigiLocker, Aadhaar, UPI, Consent Manager)

🏗️ System Architecture
The AI-Powered Healthcare Kiosk will feature:

📷 Facial Recognition-based Secure Check-in
